INTRODUCTION

Organizations collect data from multiple sources to analyze their operations and support decision-making processes. Once the data is collected, it is inspected and cleaned so that it is usable in an analysis, and exploratory activities are taken for the purposes of familiarization with the data and determining how it may support the organization’s needs.

In this assessment, you will use the raw data found in the attached “Raw Data” and “Linear Regression” files to execute a planned analysis, preparing the dataset for analysis, create a visualization, interpret the provided linear regression, and use that analysis to assess if a local police department is eligible for a special funding incentive.

SCENARIO

A local police department is interested in discovering the behavior, trends, and needs of the department based on data that has been collected. As a data analyst, you have been recruited to do consulting work for the department.


Part 1:

The police chief asks you to analyze the logs from emergency 911 calls in the city and then provide a summary of that data.

A.  Prepare a dataset from the data provided in the “Raw Data” spreadsheet, attached below. Remove any potential errors or outliers, duplicate records, or data that are not necessary. Provide a clean copy of the data in your submission.

B.  Explain why you removed each  column and row from the “Raw Data” spreadsheet, or why you imputed data in empty fields as you prepared the data for analysis.

C.  Create data sheets using your cleaned dataset, provide each  of the following to represent the requested aggregated data.

•  table: date and number of events

•  bar graph: date and number of events

•  table: number of incident occurrences by event type

•  bar graph: number of incident occurrences by event type

•  table: sectors and number of events

•  bar graph: sectors and number of events

D.  Summarize your observations from reviewing the data sheets you have created


Part 2:

The state governor has offered an additional funding incentive for police departments that are able to meet the standard of having a minimum of 2.5 officers onsite per incident. The police department has asked you to analyze their data to determine if the department will be eligible for additional funding, using the attached linear regression.

E.  Describe the fit of the linear regression line to the data, providing graphical representations or tables as evidence to support your description.

F.  Describe the impact of the outliers on the regression model, providing graphical representations or tables as evidence to support your description.

G.  Create a residual plot and explain how to improve the linear regression model based on your interpretation of the plot.

H.  Using the linear regression analysis, explain if the department qualifies for additional state funding, including any limitations posed by the available data to the assessment of the department’s current funding eligibility.

I.  Describe the precautions or behaviors that should be exercised when working with and communicating about the sensitive data in this scenario.

J.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.

K.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
